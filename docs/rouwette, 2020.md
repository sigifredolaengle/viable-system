## main ideas

### client participation
1. Experienced consultants state that the most important guarantee of modelling success is the interested participation of the client in the modelling process. (Meadows and Robinson, 1985, p. 408)
2. Jay Forrester, the founder of the field of system dynamics, has repeatedly indicated that most of the knowledge needed to construct a system dynamics model can be found in the mental database of the participants of the system to be modelled (Forrester 1961, 1987).
3. Several authors (e.g., Ackoff 1979) criticized traditional OR and systems approaches as unsuitable for ill-structured problems arising from differences between stakeholders’ views on the problem. For ill-structured problems, a range of new methods was developed (Mingers & Rosenhead, 2004).
### closed loop and system dynamics models
1. System dynamics is most easily characterized by its emphasis on two ideas: (a) the importance of closed loops of information and action for social systems, i.e., as information feedback systems, and (b) the need to use formal models to study them.
2. A causal loop diagram is composed of three main elements: variables, relationships, and feedback loops. These relationships can be either positive or negative, indicating whether the variables change in the same or opposite directions. An example is provided below for clarity.![[Captura de pantalla 2024-07-23 a las 10.02.27 1.png|500]]
3. The second important idea in system dynamics is that formal models are necessary to understand the consequences of system structure. Since system dynamics models contain many (often nonlinear) relations and feedback loops, predicting their behaviour with mathematical simulation becomes challenging and easier.
4. Two categories of variables are distinguished: stocks and flows. Stocks are entities existing at a particular point in time, such as supplies, personnel, or water in a reservoir. Flows are entities measured over a time period, such as deliveries, recruitments, or water inflow. Relationships are separated into physical flows and information flows. If we capture differences between stocks and flows and information and physical flows in a diagram, a stock and flow diagram results.

### group model building approaches
1. Several different participative model-building formats can be identified, namely, the reference group approach (Randers, 1977; Stenberg, 1980), the stepwise approach (Wolstenholme, 1992), the Strategic Forum (Richmond, 1997), modelling as learning (Lane, 1992), strategy dynamics (Warren 2000, 2005), and Hines’“standard method”(Otto and Struben, 2004). 
2. Group model building is generally conducted with a group of at least 6 and up to 15 people. The group is expertly guided by at least two persons: a facilitator and a modeller/recorder. The group is seated in a semicircle in front of a whiteboard and/or projection screen, which serves as a so-called group memory. A projection screen is typically used when a model is constructed with the aid of system dynamics modelling software with a graphic interface (e.g., Vensim, Powersim, Ithink).
3. Typical room layout for group model building with participants seated in a semicircle, whiteboard and facilitator in front, and computer and overhead projector (adapted from Andersen and Richardson, 1997).

4. The gatekeeper, who is generally also a member of the group, is the liaison between the organization and the modelling team. The gatekeeper is the contact between both parties and has an important role in deciding which participants to involve in the sessions.
5. In addition to the gatekeeper, facilitator, and recorder, two other roles are significant in a modeling session (Richardson and Andersen 1995): the process and the modeling coach. The process coach, serving as an observer, focuses on the group process, providing valuable insights.
6. In principle, the group follows the normal steps in constructing a system dynamics model. This means that the first step is the identification of the strategic issue to be discussed, preferably in the form of a so-called reference mode of behaviour, i.e., a time series derived from the system to be modelled that indicates a (historical) undesirable development over time.
7. The next step is to **elicit relevant variables** to start the model construction process. Depending on the type of problem, this will take the form of either a causal loop diagram or a stock and flow diagram and is generally referred to as the conceptualization stage.

### objectives of group model building
1. The main goal at the individual level is to change mental models and learn. The idea is that participants should better understand the relationship between structure and dynamics and how their interventions may create counterintuitive results.
2. A second goal at the individual level is behavioural change. Frequently, the conclusions of a modelling intervention point in the direction of behavioural change, such as implementing a new job rotation scheme or a change in purchasing policy.
3. At the group level, objectives refer to mental model alignment (Huz et al., 1997) and fostering consensus (Rohrbaugh, 1992; Vennix et al., 1993; Winch, 1993).
4. At the organizational level, goals have been discussed as system process change (are things done differently) and system outcome change(are customers impacted differently) (see Cavaleri and Sterman 1997). It's important to note that in many cases, system changes are the result of changes in attitude and behavior of participants in the system, underscoring their influence on the system.
5. Objectives of group model building (cfr. Rouwette and Vennix, 2006):

### designing group model building
1. The first concerns the suitability of system dynamics for the problem at hand. Systedynamicists generally say that a problem needs to be dynamically complex in order to be suitable to model it through system dynamics.
2. A second issue which needs to be given some thought is the question whether to use qualitative or quantitative modelling. In short those who disagree point out that without quantification and simulation, one cannot reliable develop a robust policy simply because the human mind is not capable of predicting the dynamic effects of (interventions in) a dynamically complex structure.
3. A third issue is the question who to involve in the sessions. There are a number of criteria which care generally employed. First it is important involve people who have the power to make deci-sions and changes. A second criterion is to involve people who are knowledgeable about the problem at hand. A third criterion is to involve a wide variety of viewpoints, in order to make sure that all relevant knowledge about the problem is included.

### conduction group model building
1. Guiding principles capture basic ideas in the interaction with clients, such as break task/group structure several times each day, clarify group products, maintain visual consistency, and avoid talking heads. Scripts are more concrete instances of these principles and refer to small elements of the interaction process (Andersen and Richardson 1997; Luna-Reyeset al.2006; Hovmand et al.2012; https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Scriptapedia). 
2. The following table shows scripts described in Andersen and Richardson’s(1997) original paper (see the following figure).
