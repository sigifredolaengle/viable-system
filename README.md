## Introduction
How do we generate effective public policies for disaster management? Under what conditions do the authorities invest in mitigation, and how? What are the relevant variables? Studies indicate that the organisation must have prior capacities to sustain policy implementation: capacities to implement, skills to innovate radically and incrementally, and social learning skills. However, all these *prescriptive* conditions depend strongly on the type of organisation and the environment or circumstances in which it operates. Although we share the normative approach, analyses of the organisation's current reality must complement it.

Our investigation into the system dynamics methodology and viability theory in organisational management has led us to propose a 4-stage method. This method, based on both approaches, underscores the need for a multi-disciplinary approach in disaster management policy generation.

The figure above shows a summary scheme of our project: a control dashboard containing four parts. The first part supports the qualitative causal analysis of the problem (CM - Causal Model). The second is a quantitative dynamic model that evaluates the variables and their relationships over time (SDM - System Dynamics Model). The third is an equilibrium analysis of the variables that can be optimized (EQ - equilibrium). Finally, the most innovative is the analysis of the system's viability (VIAB). The viability allows us to answer questions such as where we should start to ensure that the variables remain in a given constraint sector, whether we can reach any desired goal from the point where we are, can we reach any desired goal from the point where we are, can we reach any desired goal from the point where we are?

In doing this work, we found that although system dynamics has numerous applications in production and project management, viability theory is still in its infancy in management. Moreover, viability theory can be seen as a natural and necessary extension of the analysis of optimality and equilibria of dynamical systems and accurately addresses notions such as viability, invariance, and resilience.

Our conclusion is that the combined use of both approaches not only allows us to understand current capabilities and design required capabilities, but also holds great potential for the future. Similarly, the effective combination of the normative and descriptive approach gives us hope that our approach can successfully address the problem of assessing technology adoption and its impact on organizational performance.

## Activities
1. The following figure represents the general flow of activities: ![[Captura de pantalla 2024-08-05 a las 18.32.52.png]]
2. We describe each main activities as follow. The activity  **ellicitation models** is the most critical. In this phase, we ellicitate a **best** model representing the real behaviour and complexity of the system. This activity was described previously and here we show a summary: ![[Captura de pantalla 2024-08-05 a las 18.37.05.png]]
3. The second activity consists in implement the viability model. It is executed by the **viability computing team** that is composed by three integrants as show in the following figure. ![[Captura de pantalla 2024-08-05 a las 18.38.39.png|500]]
## Deadlines and resources
1. The following diagrams representas the project teams. The first one is the general tema, and the second is a typical ellicitation team.![[Captura de pantalla 2024-08-06 a las 11.15.18.png]]![[Captura de pantalla 2024-08-06 a las 11.15.40.png|500]]
